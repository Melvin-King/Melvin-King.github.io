Thrilled to receive the certificate of achievement for my outstanding contribution to the AWS Educate Cloud Ambassador Program!

This unforgettable journey has significantly enhanced my ability to bridge cloud services with industrial needs, while also comprehensively developing my teamwork and leadership skills. In my role as a tech researcher in the transport & logistics sector, I explored how web cloud service technology can make a difference and help transform global businesses. Special thanks to my recruiters for this unforgettable opportunity, and mentors for their guidance and support.
