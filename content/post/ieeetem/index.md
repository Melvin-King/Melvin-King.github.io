Delighted to share that after more than a year of effort, our research has finally been published! Honored to introduce my undergraduate work as the first author in IEEE Transactions on Engineering Management (IEEE-TEM). Our paper, "How Large Language Models Empower the Analysis of Online Public Engagement for Mega Infrastructure Projects: Cases in Hong Kong," explores how large language models and social network analysis can enhance the management and decision-making of mega projects.  

Without a doubt, this marks a significant milestone in my academic journey. A heartfelt thank you to Dr. Xue for continuous guidance, as well as R.Y. Ma and Professor Geoffrey Q.P. Shen for their invaluable support.  

Excited for whatâ€™s aheadâ€”I will keep pushing forward!
