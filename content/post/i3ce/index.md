I am so pleased to present our paper on [2024 ASCE International Conference on Computing in Civil Engineering](https://www.cmu.edu/cee/i3ce2024/index.html), held by Carnegie Mellon University! We met so many outstanding researchers and engaged in discussions on interesting topics related to civil engineering and computing.

The paper titled [“Large Language Model-based data-driven framework for digital transformation in construction industry”](https://melvin-king.github.io/publication/conference-paper/) can be found in my selected publications.
