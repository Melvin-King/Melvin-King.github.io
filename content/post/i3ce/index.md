I am so pleased to present our paper on [2024 ASCE International Conference on Computing in Civil Engineering](https://www.cmu.edu/cee/i3ce2024/index.html), held by Carnegie Mellon University! We met so many outstanding researchers and engaged in discussions on interesting topics related to civil engineering and computing.

During the presentation, we shared our study's approach, which uses a question-answering system based on LLMs and localized knowledge bases to guide decision-makers in developing engagement strategies that improve DT performance and foster collaboration, enabling automated reasoning and precise insights to be derived from extensive datasets, thus fostering a smarter DT framework to manage the DT process. We had a great time with other attendees [exploring Pittsburgh](https://melvin-king.github.io/post/pitts/) during the conference.

The paper titled [‚ÄúLarge Language Model-based data-driven framework for digital transformation in construction industry‚Äù](https://melvin-king.github.io/publication/conference-paper/) can be found in my recent publications.
