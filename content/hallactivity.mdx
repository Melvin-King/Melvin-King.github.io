After moving into the PolyU Student Halls of Residence, I often noticed colorful posters for hall activities displayed all around the elevator lobbies. Little did I know that one day I would become one of the organizers behind those very events!

In March 2023, Kaiyuan Hall and Wuhua Hall jointly planned a high table dinner—a formal, elegant banquet that brought residents together in style. I felt incredibly fortunate to join the hall association members as part of the organizing team. We spent weeks carefully planning every detail: selecting the venue, designing the menu, creating a lucky draw segment, and more. But the work didn’t stop there—the entire plan had to be compiled into a formal proposal, submitted to the hall wardens and the Student Affairs Office for review. This involved multiple rounds of feedback and meetings before we finally received approval.

Once the administrative hurdles were cleared, the real excitement began. Everyone on the team worked efficiently in their assigned roles. My main responsibility was promotion and I designed the event posters and banners, emphasizing the romantic “starry sky and candlelight” theme to capture the evening’s magical atmosphere.

The high table dinner took place successfully at the Chinese YMCA of Hong Kong. Residents enjoyed a delicious multi-course meal, watched captivating performances, and had plenty of opportunities to mingle and get to know one another from different halls in the student residence.

Living in the halls, I’ve participated in and helped organize many activities over the years. Through these experiences, I’ve gained far more than just the eligibility to stay in residence. What truly stands out is the opportunity to meet and connect with people from incredibly diverse cultural backgrounds around the world.

Working closely with them has taught me how to bridge cultural differences and turn diversity from a potential barrier into a real strength. These friendships and collaborations have enriched my university life in ways I never expected.
