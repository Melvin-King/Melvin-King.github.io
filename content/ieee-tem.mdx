I'm so delighted that after more than a year of effort, my research which commenced since undergraduate studies has finally been published in [IEEE Transactions on Engineering Management](https://www.ieee-tems.org/ieee-transactions-on-engineering-management/). The paper, ["How Large Language Models Empower the Analysis of Online Public Engagement for Mega Infrastructure Projects: Cases in Hong Kong](https://doi.org/10.1109/TEM.2025.3553595) explores how large language models (LLMs) and social network analysis (SNA) can enhance the decision-making and management of mega projects.  

Without a doubt, this marks a significant milestone in my academic journey. A heartfelt thank you to Dr. Jin Xue for his continuous guidance, as well as Professor Geoffrey Q.P. Shen for his invaluable support in research funding.

Excited for what's ahead—I will keep pushing forward!
