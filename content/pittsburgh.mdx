I am so pleased to present our paper on [2024 ASCE International Conference on Computing in Civil Engineering](https://www.cmu.edu/cee/i3ce2024/index.html), held by Carnegie Mellon University! We met so many outstanding researchers and engaged in discussions on interesting topics related to civil engineering and computing.

During the presentation, we shared our study’s approach, which uses a question-answering system based on LLMs and localized knowledge bases to guide decision-makers in developing engagement strategies that improve DT performance and foster collaboration, enabling automated reasoning and precise insights to be derived from extensive datasets, thus fostering a smarter DT framework to manage the DT process.

### City Tour

Alongside with the conference, we visited the City of Pittsburgh, a beautiful city with skyscrapers, bridges, a row of heights and trams!

Super surprised to see a rex fossil (the platform at its feet turned to a wishing pool) at the airport! We bumped into more of them at the Carnegie Museum of Natural History.

On board the well-known Duquesne Incline! It reminds me of The Peak Tram in Hong Kong Island.

It has been a routine for me to drop by the department of computer science every time I visit a new institution. Can't miss CMU!

Claimed a cozy corner at CMU library.

Flying pillows at The Andy Warhol Museum. Strange yet fanscinating! I was delighted to learn about Andy's contributions to visual artworks and his significant impact on modern human artistry.

The historic Waco 9 airplane (known as "Miss Pittsburgh") marks the city's aviation history, known for making the first airmail flight from Pittsburgh to Cleveland, Ohio!
