I'm currently based in Hong Kong, where most of my outdoor took place. I read blogs from [Hike Hong Kong](https://hikehk.com/) and [Oasistrek](https://www.oasistrek.com/) for preparation.

**Join me if you are another hiking passionate!**

It's a pity that we did not conquer the peak due to limited time. The challenge is kept for the future!

Lasting memories along the Australian National Heritage-listed 240-kilometer stretch of road.
