abstract: Mega infrastructure projects (MIPs) have profound societal impacts, and public engagement plays a crucial role in their success. The rise of social media enables the dynamic analysis of public opinions, aiding decision-makers in addressing public concerns. This study introduces an NPRM (Networking, Parsing, Retrieval, and Mapping) approach that innovatively leverages large language models (LLMs) for massive text parsing and social network analysis. Using data from Hong Kongâ€™s nine MIP topics, this study identifies influencers and examines public and influencer engagement across project lifecycles. The findings and constructed managerial maps reveal the hidden dynamics of involvement and interaction across different project event types, enabling a prioritized management method. The novel LLM-driven framework offers decision-makers actionable insights to comprehensively optimize online public communication and engagement strategies for MIPs.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: This study proposes an NPRM (Networking, Parsing, Retrieval, Mapping) approach to uncover the interactions related to online public engagement in MIPs by observing the distribution of user identities involved, identifying individuals with considerable influence, and evaluating the influencer-public interactions during various project events. Observations are used to guide project decision-makers to understand public opinion of mega projects on social networks.
