abstract: Mega infrastructure projects (MIPs) have profound societal impacts, with public engagement playing a crucial role in their performances. The rise of social media enables dynamic analysis of public opinions, helping decision-makers to address public concerns effectively. This study introduces an NPRM (Networking, Parsing, Retrieval, Mapping) approach, innovatively leveraging large language models (LLMs) for massive text parsing and social network analysis (SNA). Using data from nine MIP topics in Hong Kong, the study identifies influencers and examines influencer-public involvement and interaction across the project lifecycle, enabling a prioritized engagement method. The findings reveal patterns of involvement and interaction across various types of project events, offering actionable insights to enhance MIPsâ€™ communication and engagement strategies for decision-makers. By proposing an LLM-driven method and a practical managerial map, this study advances strategies for fostering effective online public engagement in MIPs.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: This study proposes a method to uncover the interactions related to online public engagement in MIPs by observing the distribution of user identities involved, identifying individuals with considerable influence, and evaluating the influencer-public interactions during various project events. Observations are used to guide project decision-makers to understand public opinion of engineering projects on social networks.
